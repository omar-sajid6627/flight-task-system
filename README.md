python manage.py migrate --settings=backend.settings.test
```

2. Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

3. For coverage report:
```bash
pytest --cov=.
```

## Architecture

The service uses a modern, scalable architecture:
- **FastAPI**: High-performance REST API framework
- **Django**: Robust ORM and data models
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue for async processing
- **Redis**: Message broker and caching
- **SQLite**: Development database (can be replaced with PostgreSQL for production)

## Architecture Decisions

### FastAPI + Django Combination
- **Rationale**: We chose to combine FastAPI with Django to leverage the best of both frameworks:
  - FastAPI provides high-performance async API capabilities and automatic OpenAPI documentation
  - Django offers a mature ORM, robust admin interface, and battle-tested security features
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Increased complexity in project setup
  - Better separation of concerns between API and data layers
  - Future-proof architecture that can scale independently

### Asynchronous Processing
- **Why Celery**:
  - Handles long-running flight data enrichment tasks without blocking API responses
  - Provides reliable task queuing with retry mechanisms
  - Supports task prioritization and scheduling
- **Redis as Message Broker**:
  - Low latency and high throughput
  - Built-in persistence
  - Excellent integration with Celery

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Uses SQLite for development simplicity
  - Models designed for easy migration to PostgreSQL
  - Structured for efficient querying of flight data
- **Caching Layer**:
  - Redis used for caching frequent queries
  - Reduces load on the database
  - Improves response times for repeated requests

## Feature Implementation Details

### Flight Data Enrichment
1. **Data Reception**:
   - Validates incoming flight data against JSON schema
   - Normalizes dates and times to UTC
   - Performs initial data quality checks

2. **Task Processing**:
   ```python
   # Simplified flow
   @celery_app.task(retry_policy={
       'max_retries': 3,
       'interval_start': 0,
       'interval_step': 60,
       'interval_max': 180,
   })
   def enrich_flight_data(flight_id):
       # Fetch flight details
       # Query SerpAPI
       # Process and store results
   ```

3. **Price Enrichment Logic**:
   - Queries Google Flights via SerpAPI
   - Implements smart retry mechanism for rate limits
   - Handles currency conversions and normalization

### API Design
1. **Endpoint Structure**:
   - RESTful design principles
   - Versioned endpoints for future compatibility
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Authentication & Security**:
   - Token-based authentication
   - Rate limiting per client
   - Input validation and sanitization

### Monitoring and Logging
- Structured logging format
- Performance metrics collection
- Task queue monitoring

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **SerpAPI Dependencies**:
   - Rate limits on free tier
   - Occasional inconsistency in price data
   - Limited historical data access

2. **Scalability Constraints**:
   - Single Redis instance bottleneck
   - SQLite limitations in concurrent writes
   - Basic task prioritization

3. **Long-term (6+ months)**:
   - [ ] Machine learning for price prediction
   - [ ] Geographic distribution of services
   - [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
   - [ ] Integration with additional data sources
   - [ ] Custom pricing algorithms

### Performance Optimization Plans
1. **Database Optimization**:
   - Implement database partitioning
   - Optimize indexes for common queries
   - Add materialized views for reports

2. **Caching Improvements**:
   - Implement multi-level caching
   - Add cache warming mechanisms
   - Optimize cache invalidation strategies

3. **API Enhancements**:

   - Streaming responses for large datasets
   - Batch processing capabilities

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Redis Connection Error**:
   - Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
   - Check Redis connection string in .env
   - Ensure Redis port (6379) is not blocked

2. **Celery Worker Issues**:
   - Verify Celery worker is running
   - Check logs for specific errors
   - Ensure Redis connection is stable

3. **Database Migration Issues**:
   - Delete the migrations folder and db.sqlite3
   - Run makemigrations and migrate again
   - Check Django settings for database configuration
